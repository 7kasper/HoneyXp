Now with honey bottles in your hand, right click the lightning rod.
A small amount (minimum of `7 xp`) will be transferred into the honey bottle:

You can keep right clicking the honey bottles on the rod. The XP per click will increase until the honey is fully saturated.
In total a single honey bottle can contain up to `427 xp` which comes down to about `17 levels` when counting from `0 levels`.
For a better understanding of how many xp are within certain levels see [the minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience#:~:text=1%20experience%20point.-,Leveling,-up).

## Permissions
In order to bottle your XP you need the `honeyxp.bottle` permission.  
In order to drink bottled XP you need the `honeyxp.drink` permission.  
To do both you can give the `honeyxp.*` permission.  
Players have all permissions on default.
